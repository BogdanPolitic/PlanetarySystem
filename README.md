# PlanetarySystem

<h3> Application description </h3>

Unity3D single-player desktop game.
The theme of the game is cosmic exploration. The player is joining an unreal world where he becomes a Planetary System creator. Settled up with an inventory of planet items, the player is building up planetary systems by mimicking each planet's 3D trajectory by a continuous mouse input. Depending on the current planet type (for example, Jupiter), it has a specific speed, size, and it is seemingly a real kind of that planet.

The player's final task is to manage the space of each planetary system so that the planets don't collide while rotating. If two planets collide, both will be disintegrated into smaller pieces that can potentially collide and destroy other planets as well. A broken planet fragment is not living for long until they burn entirely and they become ashes.

The game's progress depends of the current game level and the planets in the inventory. A minimum number of planets is required for each system to be completed. The broken planets obviously lose the count. If the player ends up with 0 planets in their invetory, the game is lost.
